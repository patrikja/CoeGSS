# Background

* [Patrik Jansson](https://www.chalmers.se/en/staff/Pages/patrik-jansson.aspx), Prof. of Comp. Sci., Chalmers, Sweden
    * Programming languages
    * Software technology
* Two current EU projects about "Global Systems Science (GSS)"
    * [CoeGSS.eu](http://www.CoeGSS.eu/)
    * [GRACeFUL-project.eu](http://www.GRACeFUL-project.eu/)
    * a \href{https://twitter.com/patrikja/status/299857568392704001}{``tweet-sized definition'' (from 2013)}:
\begin{quote}
GSS is about developing systems, theories, languages and tools for
computer-aided policy making with potentially global implications.
\end{quote}

Note that any computer simulation (and any model) of a global system
is bound to be a rather crude approximation in some aspects. Hopefully
we can still make it a good approximation in the aspects we want to
study.

## Earlier history:

* 2008 onwards: Collaboration with the Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research (PIK) and the Global Climate Forum (GCF)
* FP7 FET-Open project 2010-2013: GSDP (Carlo Jaeger)
* leading up to the FETPROACT1 call

# Theory and technology for "Computer-Aided policy making"

* Sequential Decision Problems TODO cite
* Economic (Game) Theory
* Agent Based Modelling
* Network Science
* [HPC was covered in the keyote yesterday]

# GSS Applications: some pilot projects

* Green Growth
* Health Habits
* Global Urbanisation
* Climate Resiliant Urban Design

TODO: fill in more about them

# GSS and language

* Any GSS model is bound to involve different scientific fields
    * what is the common specification language?
    * Mathematics
* "Computer-aided" means we also need *implementation* languages
    * often a *large* gap between mathematical model and implementation
    * need bridging: a tower of languages connected by tools

TODO: perhaps look up GRACeFUL slides about the gap?

# Challenges

* Validation & Correctness
    * Specification in computer-checked language
    * understandable for domain experts
    * static checking, interval arithmetics
    * proof tools, automated testing
* Mature implementations
    * running code /= HPC-ready code
* Access to data
    * open access data
    * integrity
    * confidentialty
    * standards
* Reproducibility
    * open source
    * models, theories
    * tools, methodologies
    * proper meta-data

# Conclusions
